# AMPed Up America
*An "amp" is the unit used to measure electric current.*

The goal of this Javascript portfolio project is to create a single-page application with information about all things energy consumption in the United States. It will be a dashboard with multiple data visualizations showing key metrics and information about historical and current trends in the energy we use, how we use it, what we use it for, and how that has changed over time. 

My main data source will be from the United States Energy Information Association. Taking advantage of their robust API I will be using javascript along with the D3 library to build my dashboard. 

### In AMPed Up America users will be able to:
  - View domestic global consumption over the years
  - View the changes in price per kilowatt hour
  - View the change in the types of energy we consume
  - View statistics on energy consumption per person on average.
  - View statistics on energy consumption based on specific activities. (driving, flying, train, etc)
  - View trends in carbon emissions over the years

### Bonus features:
  - live widget of current energy consumption in real-time 
  - some sort of simple animation visualizing the above widget?
  - fun facts or quotes about energy

 

## Implementation Timeline
- Thursday - Get a solid front-end design with a good idea of where the different elements of the dashboard will reside. Lockdown which statistics and relationships I want to present in the data and the best way to format the data for each item. 
- Friday - Write the API requests needed for the data that I need for my graphs, tables, etc. Start connecting the data I am receiving to d3. If time permits start experimenting with visualizing the data with simple graphs and charts in the browser. 
- Saturday - continue working on finalizing the data visuals and start placing them on the webpage. I plan on having multiple charts hide and unhide based on user input. Start figuring out how that will look. 
- Sunday - continue work from the past few days. I would like to be able to start styling by Monday.
- Monday to Thursday - At this point, the bare bones of the site should be working and most of my data visualizations done. Styling my charts and website and adding additional functionality time permitting.
